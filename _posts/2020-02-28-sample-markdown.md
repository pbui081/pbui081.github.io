This is the culmination of 10 long years of story content. If you don't want to be spoiled, please move along!




## Dusting off the rust
#### Even 10 years later, the gunplay remains smooth and satisfying
With the purchase of The Final Shape DLC, this upcoming season pass was automatically granted to me letting me get quick access on the DLCs new exotic weapons. My favorite auto weapon so far has been the new auto-rifle exotic, Quicksilver Storm. With it's maxed out handling, it's been an absolute joy to use with to mow down my enemies. So far the new weapons have been smooth, enjoyable, and addicting to play

## The Campaign
#### Plot? Just hand over the new weapons.

Destiny 2's campaign typically have a lot of unncecessary padding, having your guardian fly around the solar system for some random purpose. This however, whas no the case in The Last Shape. There was a sense of impending doom and there was no choice but to break through to the Witness alongside with the other characters. Compared to previous DLCs, concepts and lores introduced in previous seasons are able to be introduced within this story reasonably well without any confusions, helping me who's return to this game lacked any knowledge of prior events. The return of Cayde - which I won't detail the reasons for his sudden reappearance despite his death in the Forsaken DLC - fueld many of the story beats for this dark-toned adventure. His comedy relief throughout our jounrey to The Witness were much appreciated as it lightened the mood. However, for most of the story, I found myself blazing through the enemies and cutscenes in order to get towards the end-game content. For me, my enjoyment of the game has come from the addicting game-loop that satisfies my enjoyment of gaining loot and growing stronger to progress towards gamemodes other than the story content.

## The Witness
#### All things culminate here
